# EmailSpamDetector
This project helps users check if an email is spam or malicious. You can input email text, URLs, or upload .eml files. The system scans for threats like phishing links or bad domains using public threat intelligence sources.

The webpage is simple: paste or upload your email, and it tells you if it's safe or not. It flags suspicious content and risky links, helping protect personal inboxes from scams or malware.
